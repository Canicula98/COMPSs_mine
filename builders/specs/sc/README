=============================
 COMP SUPERSCALAR FRAMEWORK
=============================

COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming model which aims to ease the development of applications for distributed infrastructures,
such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds. COMP superscalar also features a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism of
applications at execution time.


Documentation
-------------
COMPSs documentation can be found at http://compss.bsc.es or at https://compss-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


Installation
------------
1.- Unzip the package
    $ tar -xvf COMPSs_3.3.3.post2506.tar.gz

2.- Execute the installation script
    $ cd COMPSs_3.3.3.post2506/; ./install <targetDir> [queues_cfg]


Dependencies
------------
In order to successfully run the installation script the following dependencies must be installed:
- autotools
- boost
- R (if enabled)


Usage
-----
To load the COMPSs environment please source the ${COMPSs_INSTALLATION_DIR}/compssenv in the users .bashrc file
  $ echo "# COMPSs environment" >> ~/.bashrc
  $ echo "source ${COMPSs_INSTALLATION_DIR}/compssenv" >> ~/.bashrc

To check that your environment has been loaded successfully please run:
  $ runcompss -v

For further information about how to execute applications please check the COMPSs User Manual available at our
webpage (http://compss.bsc.es) or at https://compss-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Sections/03_Execution_Environments.html


Sample Applications
